      <h2>Welcome to Pilates in Parkwater</h2>
      <p>The studio is well appointed with traditionally crafted equipment. We use the reformer, tower unit, wunda chair along with additional smaller pieces of equipment to complement the fundamental mat work.
        You will work privately with an instructor or may join a duo class where each student experiences a tailor-made studio session. Having been introduced to the matwork as it was taught by Joseph Pilates, clients are then guided to use the various equipment pieces to aid and challenge their progress as desired. 
        Your instructor will work with you towards personal goals or outcomes whether they be strength, rehabilitation, or most commonly feeling younger and fresher than when you arrived!!</p>
